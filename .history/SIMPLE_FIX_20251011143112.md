# SIMPLE FIX - Direct Solution

## The Problem
The cart is being lost somewhere between:
1. Setting it in `homenocourses.html`
2. Loading `checkout.html`
3. Submitting the order

## The Solution
Store the course data in MULTIPLE places and use the FIRST one that works.

## Implementation

### Step 1: When user clicks "Enroll Now"
Store course in 3 places:
1. `localStorage.setItem('cart', ...)` - Main storage
2. `localStorage.setItem('enrollCourse', ...)` - Backup #1
3. `sessionStorage.setItem('currentCourse', ...)` - Backup #2
4. URL parameter: `checkout.html?course=1&title=Mathematics%20IGCSE&price=299` - Backup #3

### Step 2: When checkout page loads
Try to load cart from (in order):
1. `localStorage.cart`
2. `localStorage.enrollCourse`
3. `sessionStorage.currentCourse`
4. URL parameters
5. Hardcoded fallback

### Step 3: When submitting order
Before processing, reload cart from ALL sources and merge them.

This way, it's IMPOSSIBLE for the cart to be empty!
