## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### **Users Table Updates**

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN parent_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN student_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE users ADD FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES users(id);
ALTER TABLE users ADD FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES users(id);
```

### **Relationships**
- `parent_id`: Links a student to their parent
- One parent can have multiple children (students)
- One student can have only one parent

#### Issue: "Student already linked to another parent"
**Solution**:
- The student account is already linked to a different parent
- Contact admin to unlink from previous parent first

#### Issue: Can't access parent dashboard
**Solution**:
- Verify you registered as "Parent" role
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check localStorage for `authToken`

#### Issue: 403 Forbidden errors
**Solution**:
- Ensure JWT token is valid
- Re-login to get a fresh token
- Verify role is set to 'parent' in database

// Already implemented in backend/server.js
app.post('/api/parent/link-student', authenticateJWT, (req, res) => {
    const parentId = req.user.id;
