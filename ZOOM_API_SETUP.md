# Zoom API Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
The IG Nation Learning Platform now includes real Zoom API integration for creating actual Zoom meetings from the teacher dashboards. This guide will help you set up the Zoom API credentials to enable real meeting creation.

## Current Status
- ✅ **Backend API Integration**: Complete with real Zoom API calls
- ✅ **Frontend Integration**: All three teacher dashboards updated
- ✅ **Fallback System**: Simulated meetings when API fails
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Zoom Marketplace App

1. Go to [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/)
2. Sign in with your Zoom account
3. Click **"Develop"** > **"Build App"**
4. Choose **"Server-to-Server OAuth"** (recommended for production) or **"JWT"** (for testing)
5. Fill in your app details:
   - **App Name**: IG Nation Learning Platform
   - **Short Description**: Live session integration for educational platform
   - **Company Name**: Your organization name

### Step 2: Configure App Permissions

Make sure your app has the following permissions enabled:
- ✅ **Meeting:Create** - Create meetings
- ✅ **Meeting:Read** - Read meeting details
- ✅ **Meeting:Update** - Update meeting settings
- ✅ **Meeting:Delete** - End meetings

### Step 3: Get Your Credentials

After creating your app, you'll get:
- **API Key** (Client ID)
- **API Secret** (Client Secret)
- **Account ID** (for Server-to-Server OAuth)

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with your credentials:

```env
# Zoom API Configuration
ZOOM_API_KEY=your-actual-zoom-api-key
ZOOM_API_SECRET=your-actual-zoom-api-secret
ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID=your-actual-zoom-account-id

# Other required variables
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
PORT=3000
```

### Step 5: Update Backend Configuration

The backend is already configured to use these environment variables. The system will:

1. **Check for real credentials** in environment variables
2. **Use real Zoom API** if credentials are provided
3. **Fall back to simulated meetings** if credentials are missing or invalid

## Features

### Real Zoom Integration
- ✅ **Actual meeting creation** via Zoom API
- ✅ **Real meeting IDs and passwords**
- ✅ **Proper meeting URLs and start URLs**
- ✅ **Meeting settings** (recording, waiting room, etc.)

### Smart Fallback System
- ✅ **Automatic fallback** to simulated meetings if API fails
- ✅ **User-friendly error messages** with options
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** for testing environments

### Enhanced User Experience
- ✅ **Loading states** during meeting creation
- ✅ **Automatic Zoom app detection** and opening
- ✅ **Web fallback** if Zoom app not installed
- ✅ **Meeting details sharing** with students

## Testing

### With Real Zoom API
1. Set up your `.env` file with real credentials
2. Restart the backend server
3. Create a live session from any teacher dashboard
4. You'll get a real Zoom meeting with actual meeting ID and password

### With Simulated Meetings
1. Use the system without setting up `.env` credentials
2. The system will automatically use simulated meetings
3. Perfect for testing and development

## API Endpoints

The following new API endpoints are available:

- `POST /api/zoom/create-meeting` - Create a new Zoom meeting
- `GET /api/zoom/meeting/:meetingId` - Get meeting details
- `POST /api/zoom/end-meeting/:meetingId` - End a meeting

## Security Notes

- **Never commit** your `.env` file to version control
- **Use Server-to-Server OAuth** for production (more secure than JWT)
- **Rotate your API keys** regularly
- **Monitor API usage** in your Zoom account

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"API call failed"** - Check your credentials and permissions
2. **"Meeting creation failed"** - Verify your Zoom account has meeting creation enabled
3. **"Authentication error"** - Ensure your API key and secret are correct

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by checking the browser console and backend logs for detailed error messages.

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Use **Server-to-Server OAuth** instead of JWT
2. Set up proper **environment variable management**
3. Configure **SSL certificates** for secure API calls
4. Implement **rate limiting** to prevent API abuse
5. Set up **monitoring and logging** for API usage

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your Zoom API credentials
3. Ensure your Zoom app has the correct permissions
4. Test with the simulated meeting fallback first

**Note**: The system is designed to work seamlessly with or without real Zoom API credentials, making it perfect for both development and production environments.
